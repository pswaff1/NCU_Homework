It's time for Animaniacs
And we're zany to the max
So just sit back and relax
You'll laugh 'til you collapse
We're Animaniacs
Come join the Warner brothers and the Warner sister Dot
Just for fun we run around the Warner movie lot
They lock us in the tower whenever we get caught
But we break loose and then vamoose and now you know the plot
We're Animaniacs
Dot is cute and Yakko yaks
Wakko packs away the snacks
While Bill Clinton plays the sax
We're Animaniacs
Meet Pinky and the Brain who want to rule the universe
Goodfeathers flock together
Slappy whacks 'em with her purse
Buttons chases Mindy while Rita sings a verse
The writers flipped
We have no script
Why bother to rehearse
We're Animaniacs
We have pay or play contracts
We're zany to the max
There's baloney in our slacks
We're ani-mane-y, totally insane-y
Here's the show's name-y
Animaniacs
Those are the facts
